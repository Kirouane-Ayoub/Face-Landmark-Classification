The Emotions Detection using Face Landmark Classification project is aimed at developing a system that
        can accurately detect and classify emotions from facial landmarks. It involves analyzing facial features
        such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and jawline to determine the emotional state of an individual.
        The system uses machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning models, 
        trained on a large dataset of labeled facial landmark images. The project aims to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection, 
        including emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. The system can be
        integrated into various applications, such as facial emotion recognition in human-computer interaction, 
        virtual reality, gaming, and mental health assessment. The project may also involve data preprocessing, 
        feature extraction, model training and evaluation, and optimization for real-time or embedded systems.
        Ethical considerations, such as privacy and bias, will also be taken into account in the project's implementation.
During testing, we identified that the model could benefit from further fine-tuning.
